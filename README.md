#log2onset

MATLAB script for automated creation of onset files (in ```.mat``` format) based on logfiles generated by [Presentation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation_(software\)).

The script is fairly specific to formats used by the Clinical Psychology group at the Central Institute of Mental Health.
We are happy to extend the functionality of our script and will do so for any other popular formatting variants which you would like to provide us with.

Released under the GPLv3 license.
Based on previous work performed by various members of the Clinical Psychology group at the Central Institute of Mental Health.
