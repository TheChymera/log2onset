#log2onset

MATLAB script for automated creation of onset files (in ```.mat``` format) based on logfiles generated by presentation.

Fairly specific to formats used by the Clinical Psychology group at the Central Institute of Mental Health.
We are happy to extend the functionality of our script!

Based on previous work performed by various members of the Clinical Psychology group at the Central Institute of Mental Health.
